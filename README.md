AWS Data Redundancy Removal System Project Document


Project Overview

This project is an AWS Data Redundancy Removal System designed to automatically detect and remove redundant data from Amazon S3, optimizing storage costs and improving efficiency.

Technologies Used

Amazon S3: Data storage and lifecycle management.

S3 Lifecycle Policies: Automated data transition and deletion.

AWS Lambda: Automated redundancy detection and deletion.

Amazon CloudWatch: Monitoring and logging.

AWS IAM: Secure access management.

Problem Statement

Excessive storage costs due to redundant data in S3. This system automates data redundancy removal, optimizing storage usage and reducing costs.

Project Benefits

Reduced storage costs by eliminating redundant data.

Improved storage efficiency with automated lifecycle management.

Enhanced security with IAM-based access control.

Roles and Responsibilities

Cloud Engineer (You):

Configured S3 bucket and lifecycle policies.

Developed Lambda function for redundancy detection.

Monitored the system with CloudWatch.

Set up IAM policies for secure access.

Project Scope

Implement automated data redundancy detection and removal.

Set up S3 Lifecycle Policies for automated data management.

Ensure secure access with IAM policies.

Monitor system performance with CloudWatch.

ðŸ”§ Implementation Steps

Setting Up S3 Bucket: Created and configured S3 bucket.

Defining Lifecycle Policies: Set up lifecycle rules for automated data transition and deletion.

Creating Lambda Function: Developed function to identify and remove redundant data.

Configuring CloudWatch: Set up monitoring and logging for the Lambda function.

Security Management with IAM: Configured secure access permissions.

Testing and Validation: Verified the redundancy removal system.

Testing and Validation

Tested with sample data in S3.

Verified automated data transition and deletion.

How to Deploy

Upload the Lambda function code.

Configure S3 bucket and lifecycle policies.

Set up IAM roles for secure access.

Monitor system with CloudWatch.

Team Size

A team of 5 members, including Cloud Engineers and a Project Manager.

Conclusion

This AWS Data Redundancy Removal System effectively reduces storage costs and improves data management by automating data lifecycle processes in S3.
